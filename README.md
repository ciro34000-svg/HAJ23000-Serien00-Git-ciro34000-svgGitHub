Repository to learn Git and GitHub basics"
## Introduction

This Git repository was created as part of the MAM2ADMM module to learn the basics of Git and GitHub. I am currently a beginner with these tools, but I am motivated to improve and understand how they can enhance reproducibility in data analysis.

Through this project, I aim to explore how to:
- Create and manage a GitHub repository
- Work with branches and commits
- Document my work using a README file
- Add images and follow good version control practices

This repository will serve as a learning journal to track my progress and experiments.
